### --question--

#### --text--

What is dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

Dynamic programming is a method for sorting data in a specific order.

---

Dynamic programming is a technique for optimizing database queries

---

Dynamic programming is a way to design user interfaces dynamically

#### --answer--

Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem just once, storing the solutions for future use.

### --question--

#### --text--

What are the two main properties that a problem must have to be solved using dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

The problem must have a fixed number of variables and a linear solution

---

The problem must be solvable in polynomial time and have a unique solution

---

The problem must involve sorting and searching algorithms

#### --answer--

The problem must have optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems

### --question--

#### --text--

What is memoization in dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

Memoization is a technique for compressing data to save memory.

---

Memoization is a method for sorting data in ascending order

---

Memoization is a process of encrypting data for security purposes.

#### --answer--

Memoization is a technique where you store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.

### --question--

#### --text--

How does dynamic programming differ from divide and conquer?

#### --distractors--

Dynamic programming always uses a greedy approach to solve problems

---

Divide and conquer algorithms do not use recursion.

---

Dynamic programming is only used for sorting algorithms

#### --answer--

Dynamic programming solves each subproblem only once and stores the results, while divide and conquer may solve the same subproblem multiple times.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the time complexity of the Fibonacci sequence using dynamic programming? 

#### --distractors--

O(n^2)

---

O(log n)

---

O(2^n)

#### --answer--

O(n)

### --question--

#### --text--

What is a greedy algorithm?

#### --distractors--

A greedy algorithm always finds the globally optimal solution.

---

A greedy algorithm uses backtracking to find the best solution.

---

A greedy algorithm is only used for sorting problems

#### --answer--

A greedy algorithm is an approach for solving problems by making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the difference between dynamic programming and greedy algorithms?

#### --distractors--

Dynamic programming always makes the locally optimal choice at each step

---

Greedy algorithms store solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant calculations

---

Dynamic programming is only used for problems without overlapping subproblems.

#### --answer--

Dynamic programming solves problems by combining solutions to subproblems and storing results, while greedy algorithms make a series of choices, each of which looks best at the moment.

### --question--

#### --text--

Give an example of a problem that can be solved using a greedy algorithm.

#### --distractors--

Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem optimally

---

Finding the longest path in a graph

---

Sorting an array using bubble sort.

#### --answer--

The coin change problem, where the goal is to make change for a given amount using the fewest coins possible.

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the knapsack problem, and which algorithm types can solve it?

#### --distractors--

The knapsack problem can only be solved using brute force algorithms

---

The knapsack problem is always solved using a recursive approach

---

The knapsack problem cannot be solved using dynamic programming.

#### --answer--

The knapsack problem involves selecting a subset of items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a weight limit. It can be solved using dynamic programming and greedy algorithms

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the time complexity of the 0/1 knapsack problem using dynamic programming?

#### --distractors--

O(n^2)

---

O(n log n)

---

O(2^n)

#### --answer--

O(nW), where n is the number of items and W is the maximum weight capacity

### --question--

#### --text--

What is the main characteristic of problems that can be solved using greedy algorithms?

#### --distractors--

Problems that require backtracking to find the optimal solution

---

Problems that have overlapping subproblems and require memoization

---

Problems that can only be solved using brute force methods

#### --answer--

They exhibit the greedy-choice property, meaning a global optimum can be arrived at by selecting the local optimum at each step

#### --distractors--

The activity selection problem involves finding the shortest path between two points

---

The activity selection problem is used to sort a list of activities by their start times

---

The activity selection problem can only be solved using dynamic programming

#### --answer--

The activity selection problem involves selecting the maximum number of activities that donâ€™t overlap, given their start and end times

---

Applying a divide and conquer approach to split the problem into smaller subproblems

Using a backtracking method to find the nth Fibonacci number

#### --answer--

Use an array to store the Fibonacci numbers up to n. Initialize the first two numbers, then use a loop to fill in the rest based on the formula `F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)`
